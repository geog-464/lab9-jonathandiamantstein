		<p> Q2: styleAll is calling the feature witht the postion (lat and long), explain what the  styles variable is and what is contains, the if statement is saying that if the geomtery is a point, fill colour will be changes to '#fff', opacity will be 0.5, radius  will be equal to 9, and stroke will be true. what the conditional statement is doing, what gets returned is a new symbol of the hollow cirlce  
		
		function styleAll(feature, latlng) {
	
		var styles = {dashArray:null, dashOffset:null, lineJoin:null, lineCap:null, stroke:false, color:'#000', opacity:1, weight:1, fillColor:null, fillOpacity:0 };

		if (feature.geometry.type == "Point") {
			styles.fillColor = '#fff'
			,styles.fillOpacity = 0.5
			,styles.stroke=true
			,styles.radius=9<p>	


		<p>Q3: Code to change stations in canada based on zip code to cyan color if (typeof feature.properties.ZipCode == "string") {
	    styles.fillColor = '#00FFFF'}<p>

	  	<p>Q4: feature and layer are parameters that are passed to the addPopups function as arguments when it is called by the onEachFeature option in the L.geoJson method. feature refers to the geographic feature being added to the map, and contains all of its attributes and properties such as its geometry, properties, and metadata. feature is an object with properties that are specific to the type of geographic feature being added (e.g. Point, LineString, Polygon, etc.). layer refers to the Leaflet layer that represents the geographic feature on the map. It can be used to modify the styling and behavior of the layer, such as changing its color or adding event listeners.<p>

	  	<p>Q5: layer.options.fill and layer.getLatLng() are fundamentally different because they represent different aspects of a Leaflet layer.

		layer.options.fill is a property that determines whether the layer should be filled with color. It is a boolean value (true or false) that determines whether the layer should be filled or not. This property is typically used with polygon and circle layers to determine whether they should be filled with a color or just outlined.

		On the other hand, layer.getLatLng() is a method that returns the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center point of the layer (geolocates). It is used to get the geographic location of a point or the center of a shape. This method is commonly used with markers and circles to get their exact location on the map.

		So while both layer.options.fill and layer.getLatLng() are properties/methods of Leaflet layers, they serve different purposes and provide different types of information. layer.options.fill determines whether the layer should be filled with color, while layer.getLatLng() provides the geographical location of the layer<p>
